new TODO
	-write getPieces in cmp is like startwork (?? what does this mean ??)
	-todo read up about things
	- we are prolly not interested in straights that cross end sub or start sub
	-  

TODO:
	move file so refs are inside this project
	git on git
	withEvents
	deal with " _" and :
	set sucks need to make an arraylist can check all the cases - for follows
	think about .
	does For create its own vars?
	"blah"; why do get these count? 
	looks like vars can be defined in different orders so we need to look over it twice
	$"Form1.frx" this happened once i need to fix that
	it seems files can referance other files in their folder.. need to deal with
	 	
approches	
	function call map
	varaible following
	cmp X {encode,lineencode}  
	
thought -> encoding needs to be in a file that we read-in and then edit with anything new we find
	blah = casdf	-> var
	asdf.blah		->
	blah(casdf)		->
	
	
what are these things:

what is ReDim ? 
what is $ ?

i think if we encounter a : we simply remove it... - no because of :34D2, i'll just kick it out if its at the end of a chunk

from talking to dad
- multi dimensional comparison
- look at string len
- look at what follows what
- do research
- use blocks
- use Cmp(A,B) and Cmp(B,C) to know something about Cmp(A,C)

NOTES
	i think i want cmp to be a measure
		cmp(A,B) >= 0
		cmp(A,B) + cmp(B,C) > cmp(A,C) 
	i just remove the # from Line Input # , Input # , Write # , Print # Close #.
	atm Line Input is one commmand but we also have commands Line and Input this is dangerous
	so it there is a roll of things not in the other they should count minus... maybe that make putting dead code in kill us
	does the order of the straights matter? for example if both file have S1 then S2 then S3 is that worth anything?
	two straights that would add to make a larger straight can not co-exist becuase their combo is always better

quick cmp
	- just take the biggest string and then the next biggest.. and so on
	- need to get some data on if this is accerate or not
